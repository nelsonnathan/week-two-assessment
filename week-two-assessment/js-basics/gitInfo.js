    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties
